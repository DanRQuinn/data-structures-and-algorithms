## Approach & Efficiency

Time: O(n)
Space: O(1)

## Solution

def kth_from_end(self, k):
        current = self.head
        length = 0
        while current is not None:
            current = current._next
            length += 1
        if k < 0 or k >= length:
            raise TargetError("Target is out of range")
        current = self.head
        for i in range(length - k - 1):
            current = current._next
        return current.value
