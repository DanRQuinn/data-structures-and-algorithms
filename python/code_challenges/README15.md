# Challenge 13

Node
Create a Node class that has properties for the value stored in the node, the left child node, and the right child node.
Binary Tree
Create a Binary Tree class
Define a method for each of the depth first traversals:
pre order
in order
post order
Each depth first traversal method should return an array of values, ordered appropriately.
Binary Search Tree
Create a Binary Search Tree class
This class should be a sub-class (or your languages equivalent) of the Binary Tree Class, with the following additional methods:
Add
Arguments: value
Return: nothing
Adds a new node with that value in the correct location in the binary search tree.
Contains
Argument: value
Returns: boolean indicating whether or not the value is in the tree at least once.
