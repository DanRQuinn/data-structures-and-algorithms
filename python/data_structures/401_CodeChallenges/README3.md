## Challenge 3

Write a function called BinarySearch which takes in 2 parameters: a sorted array and the search key. Without utilizing any of the built-in methods available to your language, return the index of the arrayâ€™s element that is equal to the value of the search key, or -1 if the element is not in the array.

## Approach & Efficiency

This uses a if else statment that uses low high and mid and depending on if x is low high or mid to continue the loop until it finds the correct index

Big O include a time complexity of 0(1) and space complexity

## Solution

def BinarySearch(arr, x):

		low = 0

		high = len(arr) - 1

		mid = 0

		while low <= high:

				mid = (high + low) // 2

				if arr[mid] < x:

						low = mid + 1

				elif arr[mid] > x:

						high = mid - 1

				else:

						return mid

		return -1

arr = [2, 3 ,4 ,10, 40]

x = 10

result = binary_search(arr, x)

if result != -1:

		print("Element is present at index", str(result))

else:

		print("Element is not present in array")
